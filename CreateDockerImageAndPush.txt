1- create docker file inside your app directory
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:21-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the jar file into the container
COPY target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose the application port (adjust based on your app's settings)
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]


2- build your app 
mvn clean package --> java app


3- build the docker image
--> docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name:version

4- login to your docker hub
docker login


5- push the image to docker hub
docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name:version


after that you can run the image from docker hub

--> docker pull your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name:verison
--> docker run -p 8080:8080 yourdockerhub-username/your-app0name:version
